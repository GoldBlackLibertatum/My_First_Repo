Law of Sines Equation if we take the output desired and create a line directly from the coveted location that the eye will approach Orlando given an angle of and a starting location (10 miles to 1000 miles given parameters) of the Hurricane. If the line is created, we are given an "opposite" side which is the target output

Equation = hypotenuse(input1) x sin (angle) (input 2) = h(opposite side/output)

Note (You need to convert degrees to radians before putting in it sin(x) numpy function or pi x degrees/180 = radians for input in to numpy function

"Not really, look at this general triangle and imagine it is two right-angled triangles sharing the side h:

The sine of an angle is the opposite divided by the hypotenuse, so:

triangle a b c sin(A) = h/b so symbol b sin(A) = h sin(B) = h/a so symbol a sin(B) = h a sin(B) and b sin(A) both equal h, so we get:

a sin(B) = b sin(A)

Which can be rearranged to:

a sin A = b sin B

We can follow similar steps to include c/sin(C)"
