# Math Necessary for Practice and ProjectÂ¶

**Key: N = nickels, D = Dimes**
Given Variables
1. Total Cost of Coins or .85  
2. Total Coins

**Equations:**
1. Total Cost =.05 x N +.1 x D 
2. Total Coins = N + D

## Route 1/Simplification:

2 Nickels = 1 Dime or Cost of 2 Nickels is 1 Dime

Total Coins = 2N + N 10 = 3n 10/3 = N

.85 = 2(.5)(2N) + .05 (N)

.85 = 2(.5)(2N) + .05 (N)

.85 = .20N + .05N

.85 = .15N

.85/.25 = N

3.4 = N

(Coins are whole intergers)

3.4 = N

6.6 = D

3 = N

7 = D (Check)

Total Coins = 3 + 7 = 10

Total Cost = .15 + .7 = .85

(or)

## Route 2/Substitution:

D = 10-N

.85 = .1(10-N) + .05(N)

.85 = 1-.1N + .05N

.1n-.05n =1-.85

.05n = .15

n = 3
